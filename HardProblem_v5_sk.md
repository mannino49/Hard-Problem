# Bridging the Hard Problem: Metastability, Information Theory, and the Subjective Nature of Consciousness

## Abstract

A concise summary introducing the hard problem of consciousness, the role of information in neural excitation, and the hypothesis that metastable neurodynamics, informed by information theory, may provide insights into subjective experience. Briefly outline the key arguments, including a discussion of altered states like flow and their implications for understanding consciousness.

## Introduction

The human brain is a biological system uniquely equipped to process, integrate, and respond to vast amounts of information, enabling complex cognitive functions and adaptive behavior. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness—the foundation of subjective experience—remain one of the greatest enigmas in science. The hard problem of consciousness, first articulated by Chalmers (1995), highlights the profound explanatory gap between the physical processes of the brain and the subjective quality of experience, or qualia. While neuroscience has made significant strides in mapping the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC)—including specific brain regions and network dynamics linked to awareness (Koch et al., 2016)—the mechanisms by which these physical processes generate the ineffable "what it feels like" aspect of conscious experience remain elusive. This divide underscores the challenge of moving from descriptive correlates to causative models that can account for the emergence of subjectivity.

Theoretical frameworks such as Integrated Information Theory (IIT) (Tononi, 2008) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT) (Dehaene & Changeux, 2011) have advanced our understanding of consciousness by conceptualizing it as an emergent property of complex neural activity. IIT quantifies consciousness as the degree of integrated information within a system, providing a mathematical lens for analyzing its structure and complexity (Balduzzi & Tononi, 2008). In contrast, GWT emphasizes the role of a central "workspace" that globally broadcasts information to various cognitive modules, enabling processes such as attention, decision-making, and memory (Baars, 1988). Despite their contributions, these models fall short of addressing a critical question: why does such intricate information processing give rise to the subjective phenomena of consciousness? Tackling this question demands a paradigm shift, integrating insights from neuroscience, information theory, quantum physics, and philosophy to address the ontological roots of experience (Northoff & Lamme, 2020).

While classical theories of consciousness often emphasize localized brain activity or global coordination, recent advances in network neuroscience suggest that dynamic, metastable states play a pivotal role. Metastability refers to transient configurations of neural activity that balance stability and adaptability, enabling seamless transitions between functional states (Tognoli & Kelso, 2014). These dynamic patterns allow the brain to flexibly integrate and process information while maintaining coherence—a property likely central to the emergence of consciousness. This paper posits that consciousness arises as an emergent phenomenon from these metastable states of neural activity, where information processing achieves a delicate equilibrium between order and chaos.

A key insight supporting this framework is the observation that information excites nervous tissue, a foundational principle of sensory processing, learning, and cognitive adaptation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). Sensory inputs, for instance, excite specific neurons in primary sensory cortices, translating external stimuli into electrochemical signals that propagate across networks. Early neuroscience, including the receptive field dynamics described by Hubel and Wiesel (1962) and the synaptic plasticity mechanisms articulated in Hebb's rule (1949), laid the groundwork for understanding these processes. Beyond excitation, however, neural circuits operate as dynamic systems, continuously integrating and refining information through feedback loops, recurrent networks, and parallel processing pathways.

Crucially, predictive coding frameworks (Friston, 2010) have expanded our understanding of how the brain actively processes information. Predictive coding suggests that the brain minimizes prediction errors by constantly comparing incoming sensory inputs with internal models. Discrepancies between predictions and reality—manifesting as surprising or salient information—trigger heightened neural excitation and engage key neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine (Schultz et al., 1997) and norepinephrine (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005). These mechanisms highlight the brain's capacity not only to react but to anticipate and adapt, underpinning the flexible yet coherent nature of conscious processing.

Consciousness, however, cannot be reduced to the excitation of individual circuits alone. Instead, we propose that it reflects a higher-order organization of neural activity, wherein distributed systems maintain phase coherence across spatially and temporally distinct regions. Phase coherence refers to the synchronization of oscillatory activity across networks, enabling the integration of diverse information streams into a unified whole (Fries, 2005). It is within this intricate weave of excitation, integration, and coherence that consciousness emerges—a dynamic system balancing the competing demands of stability and change, unity and diversity.
