[![Qualia Dynamics](phase_space_projection.png)](https://github.com/mannino49/Hard-Problem)

## üåå Overview

This repository contains a computational exploration of the "Hard Problem of Consciousness" - the enigmatic question of how and why physical brain processes give rise to subjective experience. Through mathematical modeling and visualization, we simulate the emergence of qualia (subjective conscious experiences) from information processing dynamics.

## üî¨ The Model

Our approach models consciousness as an emergent property arising from the dynamic interplay of three key components:

### Core Components

1. **Information Flow (I)**: Represents the flow of sensory and neural information through brain networks
2. **Metastability (M)**: Captures the balance between integration and segregation in neural dynamics
3. **Coordination Dynamics (C)**: Models the orchestration of neural activity across distributed brain regions
4. **Qualia Potential (Q)**: The accumulated potential for conscious experience that emerges from coordination dynamics

### Mathematical Framework

The model is governed by a set of coupled differential equations:

```
dI/dt = Information flow dynamics (simulated with oscillatory patterns + noise)
M(t) = |dI/dt| * (1 - I/I_max)  # Metastability function
dC/dt = Œ± * I(t) * M(t) - Œ≤ * C(t)  # Coordination dynamics
Q(t) = ‚à´C(t)dt  # Qualia potential as temporal integration of coordination
```

When Q(t) exceeds threshold Œ∏, qualia (conscious experience) emerges.

## üéÆ Simulations

This repository includes:

1. **Basic Qualia Simulation** (`qualia_simulation.py`): Simulates the core dynamics and visualizes the relationships between information flow, metastability, coordination, and qualia potential.

2. **Advanced Visualization** (`qualia_dynamics_visualization.py`): Creates sophisticated visualizations of the phase space dynamics, including:
   - 2D phase space projections
   - 3D attractor dynamics
   - Animated trajectories showing the evolution of the system

## üß™ Experiment

Experiment with different parameter values to observe how they affect the dynamics of consciousness:

- `alpha`: Coupling strength between information and metastability
- `beta`: Decay rate of coordination dynamics
- `I_max`: Maximum information capacity
- `theta`: Qualia threshold

## üîÆ Implications

This computational approach suggests that consciousness may emerge from specific patterns of information processing in complex systems. The metastable dynamics observed in our simulations mirror properties observed in brain activity during conscious states, potentially offering insights into the nature of subjective experience.

## üöÄ Future Directions

- Integration with empirical neural data
- Expanded parameter exploration
- Connection to philosophical theories of consciousness
- Applications to artificial consciousness research
